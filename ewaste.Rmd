While taking the course **Environmental Epidemiology** at Lehigh University, I investigated the health impacts of electronic waste (e-waste) in Latin America. This project involved sourcing public data, proposing a statistical analysis plan, and conducting analyses to address our research question.

### Background

E-waste is increasing globally by **3.5% annually**, posing significant environmental and health risks. Improper disposal enables metals to leach into **groundwater** and **soil**, while **semi-volatile compounds** are emitted into the air.

**Top E-waste Exposure Pathways:**  
- **Dermal Exposure:** Handling lead-contaminated e-waste.  
- **Inhalation Exposure:** Breathing fumes from burning e-waste.  
- **Ingestion Exposure:** Drinking water contaminated by lead from improperly disposed e-waste.  

> In Latin America, **97% of e-waste is improperly managed**.

**Research Question:**  
What are the health impacts of e-waste on **premature deaths** and **DALYs (disability-adjusted life years)** in **Costa Rica, Colombia, and Chile** from 2010–2019? How have these impacts changed over time?

### Methods

- **Data Source:** Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  
- **Analysis Techniques:**  
  - Trend visualization and simple linear regression.  
  - **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs):**  
    - Investigate the relationship between e-waste and health outcomes.  
    - Predict DALYs related to lead exposure.
    
### Results

##### E-waste Trends
- All three countries showed increases in e-waste from 2010–2019.
- **Colombia** had the largest increase: **12.67 thousand tonnes/year** (*p = 3.76e-09*).

##### Premature Deaths Due to Lead
- **Costa Rica**: Significant decrease (**−0.029 per year**).  
- **Colombia**: Significant decrease (**−0.019 per year**).  
- **Chile**: Smaller decrease (**−0.0026 per year**).

##### DALYs and E-waste
- **Costa Rica**: Significant positive correlation between e-waste and DALYs due to lead (*β = 34.251, p = 0.0072*).  
- **Chile** and **Colombia**: Results were not statistically significant.

### Discussion

The application of the generalized additive mixed-effect model (GAM) allowed for a more accurate understanding of the relationship between e-waste and health outcomes in Latin America, providing significant insights despite the model's limitations due to the small sample size.

Future studies should focus on expanding the dataset with more years of e-waste data, as well as incorporating **longitudinal exposure assessment** and **biomonitoring data** from individuals in direct contact with e-waste, to improve the model's predictive power and inform more effective health interventions.
