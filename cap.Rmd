While taking the **Honors Senior Capstone** course at Lehigh Universityâ€™s College of Health, I led my project group, taking on greater responsibility to delegate tasks and perform advanced work while incorporating group inputs at every step of the project.

#### **Background**


**Research Question:** 

Investigating Health Disparities Among People Living with Disabilities in NYC: Using 2020 NYC Community Health Survey data to explore the impact of access to health and social cohesion on disparities in health outcomes:

- Analysis on Health Inequalities & social variables 

- Analysis on access to care & health outcome 

- Analysis on social network & health outcome 



#### **Methods**
**Data Source and Analysis** 

For this analysis, we utilized data from the **2020 New York City Community Health Survey (CHS)**, an annual, cross-sectional survey conducted by the **New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene**. The CHS provides citywide estimates of health status, access to care, and health behaviors for the adult population of New York City.

Disability was defined using two criteria: 

(1) Respondents who reported "yes" to the self-reported disability question and 
(2) Those who reported "yes" to the use of assistive technology. 

These variables were used to examine the relationship between disability and various health outcomes.

We employed **logistic regression models** to predict self-reported health status, specifically focusing on four chronic conditions: diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and obesity. The models incorporated key predictors, including access to care, social cohesion, and socioeconomic status, to assess their impact on health outcomes. Demographic variables such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and borough of residence were also included as control variables to adjust for potential confounding effects.

This analysis aimed to identify significant determinants of health disparities among individuals with disabilities, providing insights into the intersection of health, access to care, and social determinants in the urban context of New York City.



#### **Discussion**

This study explored health disparities among older adults with disabilities in New York City using 2020 Community Health Survey data. Our findings emphasize the underrepresentation of poverty in official federal measures, as they do not account for out-of-pocket medical expenses, which are significant for older adults. This highlights the need for a broader measure of poverty to fully capture the financial challenges faced by this population.

While social cohesion was expected to influence health outcomes, the results were inconsistent across models. Although there was some positive correlation, the relationship was not as strong as anticipated, suggesting that other social determinants may play a larger role.

A key limitation of the study was the CHS's limited definition of disability, which may not capture the full extent of disability in older adults. Additionally, the absence of geocode data prevented us from exploring geographical variations in health outcomes of the built environment for those living with a disability.

Despite these challenges, the findings suggest that social determinants, such as economic stability and social support, are more influential on health outcomes than access to care. Future research should incorporate more detailed disability data and geographical variables to better understand these disparities.
